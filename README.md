# 3d-cymatics-simulator
Interactive 3D Cymatics Simulator with real-time audio visualization

An interactive web-based application that demonstrates the fascinating physics of cymatics - the study of visible sound and vibration. Experience how sound frequencies create beautiful geometric patterns in 3D space.

## 🌟 Features

- **Real-time 3D Visualization** of cymatic patterns
- **Audio Generation** with accurate frequency synthesis
- **Microphone Input** for live audio visualization
- **Multiple Boundary Conditions** (plate, sphere, cube)
- **Frequency Presets** including Solfeggio frequencies
- **Interactive 3D Navigation** with mouse controls
- **High-Resolution Particles** (16,384 particles for detailed patterns)

## 🚀 Try It Live

**[Launch the Simulator](https://yourusername.github.io/3d-cymatics-simulator/)**

## 🎮 How to Use

1. **Start the Simulation**: Click the "Start" button
2. **Adjust Frequency**: Use the slider (20-500 Hz) or try presets
3. **Enable Sound**: Toggle sound generation to hear the frequencies
4. **Navigate**: Left-click and drag to rotate, scroll to zoom
5. **Try Audio Input**: Enable microphone for real-time visualization
6. **Explore Shapes**: Switch between plate, sphere, and cube boundaries

## 🎵 Special Frequencies

- **432 Hz**: Universal frequency, said to be in harmony with nature
- **528 Hz**: Love frequency, associated with healing
- **174 Hz, 285 Hz, 396 Hz**: Solfeggio healing frequencies

## 🔬 Physics

The simulator uses the 3D wave equation to model standing wave patterns. Particles settle at nodal points where vibration is minimal, creating the characteristic cymatic patterns observed in real experiments.
